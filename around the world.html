        <h1>Around the world</h1>
        <h3>IWD is an official holiday in several countries worldwide, including Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, China (for women only), Cuba, Georgia, Germany (Berlin only), Guinea-Bissau, Eritrea, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Madagascar (for women only), Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia.</h3><br>
        <img id="aimg" style="width: 100%;" src="https://diversity-inclusion-speakers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/international-womens-day.jpeg" alt=""><br><br>
        <h3>In some countries, such as Australia, Cameroon, Croatia, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Vietnam, and Chile; IWD is not an official public holiday, but is widely observed nonetheless.
<br>
            Regardless of legal status, in much of the world, it is customary for men to give female colleagues and loved ones flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers. In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the Parliament of the Czech Republic in 2004 on the proposal of the Social Democrats and Communists. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.
<br>         
            IWD is widely celebrated in France as Journée internationale des droits des femmes (literally "International womens' rights day").</h3><br>
        <img id="aimg" style="width: 100%;" src="https://images.thequint.com/thequint%2F2022-03%2F86f20d64-6886-4112-9c95-8f582096c84f%2FiStock_1367374574.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true" alt=""><br><br>
        <h3>In Italy, the holiday is observed by men giving yellow mimosas to women. This originated with communist politician Teresa Mattei, who chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD because the predominant symbols of the day, violets and lily-of-the-valley, were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.
<br>
            In the United States, actress and human rights activist Beata Pozniak worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the US Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, by Beata Pozniak suggestion, the H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Representative Maxine Waters, along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation. In Pakistan, the Aurat March has challenged misogyny since 2018.
<br>            
            Several countries, including Uruguay, Spain, Italy, France and Algeria, have squares or other public spaces named after 8 March in a reference to International Women's Day.</h3>
