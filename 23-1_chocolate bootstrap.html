                <p class="fs-4 text-white">homemade milk chocolate bar </p>
                <p  class="fs-5 text-white">For those deciding to make a homemade chocolate recipe for the first time, dark chocolate is usually the go-to. However, it‚Äôs just as simple to make this delicious homemade milk chocolate recipe with just four ingredients and no refined sugars!
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-white">This homemade chocolate recipe enables you to be 100% in control of the amount of sweetener included, is easily customized and flavored, and healthier than traditional chocolate due to the use of raw, unprocessed cacao butter and powder.
                </p>

                Learning how to make chocolate at home is also great for those who love white, milk, and dark chocolate, as the process is almost identical ‚Äì and incredibly simple to flavor too. In fact, if you‚Äôre interested in making white chocolate and sweetened or unsweetened dark chocolate, I have a recipe for that too!
                </p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white">In fact, I even have the full method for how to make chocolate from bean to bar; made 100% at home using cocoa beans. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-white"> I talk about the process of gathering the various individual ingredients from the cocoa pod in my white chocolate post and go through the entire chocolate-making process here. Ultimately cacao refers to products taken from the un-roasted beans ‚Äì thus the least (minimally) processed option as well as being ‚Äòraw‚Äô compliant for those eating a raw diet. Due to the lack of processing, this is also meant to be the healthiest option (it is more natural).
                </p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white">raw cacao butter </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-white">Cacao is actually one of the highest sources of antioxidants in foods, containing protein, fiber, iron, magnesium, as well as a high amount of flavonoids.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-white"> In comparison, cocoa powder has been heat-treated, which will have reduced some of the nutrition. However, it is still fairly good nutritionally and the more cost-effective option of the two.
                </p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white"> In terms of flavor, cacao powder is more bitter in flavor but also is a richer ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô flavor. Meanwhile, cocoa powder is slightly more mellow. You can actually make your own cacao powder too!

               <p class="fs-3 text-white"> HOW TO MAKE MILK CHOCOLATE</p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white">This homemade milk chocolate comprises just 4 ingredients (plus salt)  and a few simple steps. The ingredients include:
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-white">Cacao Butter (or cocoa butter) ‚Äì Make sure to use food-grade.
               </p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white"> Dry Milk Powder ‚Äì or Coconut Milk Powder/soy milk powder for a dairy-free version. 
               </p>
               <p class="fs-5 text-white"> Cacao Powder (or cocoa powder) ‚Äì This is usually very easy to source in stores or online. You can even make it at home!
              </p>
              <p class="fs-5 text-white"> Salt ‚Äì Just a pinch of salt really enhances the cacao flavor and adds depth to it. 
                </p>
                <p class="fs-5 text-warning">(Optional) Sweetener ‚Äì Use your favorite powdered sugar/sugar-free sweetener: coconut sugar, cane sugar, monk fruit powder, erythritol, etc. AVOID liquid sweetener, though, like maple, as they can cause the chocolate to seize. If you only have granulated sugar, you can make your own powdered sugar.
